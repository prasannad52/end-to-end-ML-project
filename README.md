# Student Exam Performance Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This is an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** that predicts a student's math score based on various input features such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask** (for web deployment)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for ML model)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)

## 🎯 Features
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Web Application with Flask
- Interactive Form to Input Student Details
- Real-time Prediction

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasannad52/mlproject
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mlproject
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Open your browser and go to:
   ```

   ```

## 📊 Model Performance
- Achieved **high accuracy** on test data.
- Evaluated using metrics like **R² score, MSE, MAE**.

## 🎥 Project Inspiration
This project was built by following a **YouTube tutorial** to enhance my understanding of end-to-end ML project development.

## Inspiration: 
This project is built by following Krish Naik’s YouTube tutorial on end-to-end Machine Learning deployment. I have made modifications and improvements to enhance my learning.
